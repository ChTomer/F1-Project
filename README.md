# F1-Project - Data Analysis Project

## Introduction:
Hi, I’m Tomer, I’m currently learning at **New York City Data Science Academy.**\
In this project, I’m practicing working with Python, Git and GitHub.
## Data:
The F1-data came from here: *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020* \
When the last update was on August 2023.

I also used this data for the countries list: *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rinichristy/countries-gdp-19602020*

 

## Getting started:
I used a few different kinds of visual techniques for practice and to visualize the data. Such as:

`pandas` , `matplotlib` , `seaborn` , `plotly.graph_objects` , `plotly.express` , `squarify` , `Waffle` , `PIL` and many more.


In case you want to run this code, my file path for the csv files is: `archive/'file_name'`.

So if you’re trying to run my code, make sure to put the `.ipynb` files in a folder that contains your archive folder. (like here)\

## How does it work?
So if I'll be honest, in these files there are a bunch of visuals that I used for my presentation.\
I'll add later a link to watch the PowerPoint/ Google Slides
